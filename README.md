# Overview
"Code Slob" refers to the subtle technical debt, unnecessary verbosity, and over-complexity often introduced by AI coding agents or rapid development. While functional, "slob" code is harder to maintain and prone to future regressions. The **Code Slob Cleanup** project builds an automated toolchain—packaged as a coding agent skill—to identify, refactor, and rigorously verify Python code to remove this debt.

Currently, the project only supports python codebases.

# How to use

See [getting started](https://jazz23.github.io/CodeSlobCleanup/#getting-started) for installation and usage instructions.

# Core Objectives
1.  **Automated Identification**: Detect refactoring targets using static analysis metrics (Cyclomatic Complexity, LoC, nesting depth) and semantic analysis via the agent to identify redundant logic.
2.  **Safe Refactoring**: Employs your agent to perform code transformations such as function decomposition, visibility enforcement (Converting public to private), and dead code removal.
3.  **Rigorous Verification**: Ensure behavioral equivalence using **Property-Based Testing**: Leveraging **Hypothesis** to verify `Original(input) == Transformed(input)` across thousands of inputs.
4.  **Autonomous Self-Correction**: Integrate verification feedback directly into the refactoring loop, allowing the agent to "fix its own fixes" based on counter-examples found during testing.

# Architecture
The system follows an iterative loop:
*   **Scanner**: Traverses the codebase and finds code slob.
*   **Refactor Agent**: Analyzes flagged code and generates a cleaned-up version.
*   **Verifier**: An isolated orchestrator executes Hypothesis tests, and benchmarks performance.
*   **Feedback Loop**: If verification fails, the failing test cases are fed back to your agent for a retry.
*   **Committer**: Applies the change if verification passes and performance is not regressed.

# Technologies
*   **Language**: Python 3.14+
*   **Package Management**: `uv` (PEP 723 for standalone scripts)
*   **Testing**: Hypothesis (Property-based), Pytest
*   **Benchmarking**: Matplotlib/Numpy for performance comparison
